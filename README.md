# CPP-Workshop-Auriga
C++ Workshop - Auriga - Shahid Beheshti University Robotics Lab - 2023 and 2024

This repository contains educational materials from two C++ programming workshop courses.

These workshops were conducted in person in November and December of 2023 and 2024 under the supervision of the Robotics Scientific Association of Shahid Beheshti University. They were held at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Shahid Beheshti University and delivered in Persian with a focus on C++ programming.

The courses covered both basic and intermediate topics in C++ programming. They were designed to be practice-oriented, emphasizing implementation and algorithmic thinking. As a result, a significant portion of the course content was dedicated to problem-solving. Questions, along with their solutions, have been included in this repository.

The final project of the 2023 course was the implementation of the game **"Minesweeper"**. The efforts of all students in implementing the project and exercises were commendable. The top three implementations of the final project were by "Mahdi Azimi", "Amir Reza Ramsh", and "Mohammad Esteghamat." (The codes can be found in the repository).

The final project of the 2024 course is actually two projects: 1) The implementation of the game **"Ludo"**; 2) The implementation of two **machine learning** algorithms(Genetic Algorithm & Linear Regression)

Unlike some educational workshops where the content is repeated each year like an open-loop system, we made an effort to improve the structure of the second-year curriculum based on feedback from the first year and to keep ourselves up-to-date.
( If this process continues for a hundred years, we will still follow the same approach. :) )
As a result, the problems and projects from the first and second years are certainly not identical. Additionally, some topics were added to the course content in the second year.
Therefore, problem-solving enthusiasts are encouraged to review the problems and projects from both years.

If anyone is interested in expanding the above programming problems and educational content, I would be delighted to connect through the provided contacts.

Finally, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the friends of the Robotics Association of Shahid Beheshti University, the members of the Auriga Robotics Team, and the esteemed teaching assistants who helped organize this courses.
