# CPP-Workshop-Auriga
C++ Workshop - Auriga - Shahid Beheshti University Robotics Lab - 2023

This workshop was conducted in person in November and December 2023 under the supervision of the Robotics Association of Shahid Beheshti University, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Shahid Beheshti University, and was delivered in Persian with a focus on C++ programming.

The course covered both basic and intermediate C++ programming topics. It was designed to be practice-oriented with an emphasis on implementation and algorithmic thinking. Consequently, a significant portion of the course content was dedicated to problem-solving; questions along with their solutions have been placed in this repository.

The final project of the course was the implementation of the game **"Minesweeper"**. The efforts of all students in implementing the project and exercises were commendable. The top three implementations of the final project were by "Mahdi Azimi", "Amir Reza Ramsh", and "Mohammad Esteghamat." (The codes can be found in the repository).

Finally, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the friends of the Robotics Association of Shahid Beheshti University, the members of the Auriga Robotics Team, and the esteemed teaching assistants who helped organize this course.
